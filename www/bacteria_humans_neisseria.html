						<strong>About</strong>
						<br/>
						 Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a species of Gram-negative cocci, usually seen in pairs with the adjacent sides flattened, it is pathogenic to humans who are its only natural host, it is responsible for the disease Gonorrhea. 

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease of worldwide importance. The highest attack rate in both men and women occurs between 15 and 29 years of age. Host-related factors such as the number of sexual partners, contraceptive practices, sexual preference, and population mobility contribute to the incidence of Gonorrhea. Neisseria gonorrhoeae can grow and multiply easily in warm, moist areas, including the cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes in women, and in the urethra in women and men. The bacterium can also grow in the mouth, throat, eyes, and anus. 

Gonorrhea is spread through contact with the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus. Ejaculation does not have to occur for gonorrhea to be transmitted or acquired. Gonococci adhere to columnar epithelial cells, penetrate them, and multiply on the basement membrane. Adherence is facilitated through pili and opa proteins. 

In males there is typically a 2-3 day incubation period after which a purulent discharge from the urethra and dysuria develops. Around 95% of infected males are symptomatic. Rare complications include prostatitis, epididymitis, and periurethral abcesses. Neisseria gonorrhoeae primarily infects the cervix in women however the symptoms of gonorrhea are often mild and most women who are infected have no symptoms. Even when a woman has symptoms, they can be so non-specific as to be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, dysuria, and abdominal pain. Complications from an ascending infection include absesses of the ovarian tubes and pelvic inflammatory disease. Around 10%-20% of infected women develop these complications. In 1%-3% of infected women and a lower percentage of infected men the bacterium disseminates via the blood causing bacteremia and arthritis.

										<h3>Neisseria Gonorrhoeae Pictomicrograph</h3>						
										<p>
										In the United States, Chlamydia trachomatis (tra-KO-ma-tis) is responsible for more cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than any other organism. Sexually transmitted diseases are passed from one partner to another during sexual activity. It is estimated that between 4 and 8 million people are infected in the United States by Chlamydia trachomatis every year.
Chlamydia trachomatis also causes an eye infection called trachoma (tra-KO-ma), which is an inflammation of the membrane covering the eye. It causes the eye to become irritated and red with a thick discharge. Infants whose mothers' have Chlamydia infections may become infected during birth. These infants can develop eye infections a few days after birth or pneumonia several weeks after birth.
