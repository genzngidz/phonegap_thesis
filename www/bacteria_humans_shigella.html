						<strong>About</strong>
						<br/>
						 Shigella is a species of enteric bacteria that causes disease in humans and other primates. The disease caused by the ingestion of Shigella bacteria is referred to as shigellosis, which is most typically associated with diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. “Shigella infection is the third most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States, after Salmonella infection and Campylobacter infection and ahead of E. coli O157 infection.”
In general, Shigella is one of the most communicable and severe forms of the bacterial-induced diarrheas. No group of individuals is immune to shigellosis, but certain individuals are at increased risk. Small children acquire Shigella at the highest rate, and persons infected with HIV experience shigellosis much more commonly than other individuals.
Shigella is easily spread person-to-person because of its relatively tiny (compared to other bacteria) infectious dose. Infection can occur after ingestion of fewer than 100 bacteria.  Another reason Shigella so easily cause infection is because the bacteria thrive in the human intestine and are commonly spread both by person-to-person contact and through the contamination of food.

										<h3>Shigella Micrograph</h3>						
										<p>
										In the United States, Chlamydia trachomatis (tra-KO-ma-tis) is responsible for more cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than any other organism. Sexually transmitted diseases are passed from one partner to another during sexual activity. It is estimated that between 4 and 8 million people are infected in the United States by Chlamydia trachomatis every year.
Chlamydia trachomatis also causes an eye infection called trachoma (tra-KO-ma), which is an inflammation of the membrane covering the eye. It causes the eye to become irritated and red with a thick discharge. Infants whose mothers' have Chlamydia infections may become infected during birth. These infants can develop eye infections a few days after birth or pneumonia several weeks after birth.
