					<h2>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>About</strong>
						<br/>
						 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, asporogenous, and monoflagellated bacterium that has an incredible nutritional versatility. It is a rod about 1-5 µm long and 0.5-1.0 µm wide. P. aeruginosa is an obligate respirer, using aerobic respiration (with oxygen) as its optimal metabolism although can also respire anaerobically on nitrate or other alternative electron acceptors. P. aeruginosa can catabolize a wide range of organic molecules, including organic compounds such as benzoate. This, then, makes P. aeruginosa a very ubiquitous microorganism, for it has been found in environments such as soil, water, humans, animals, plants, sewage, and hospitals. In all oligotropic aquatic ecosystems, which contain high-dissolved oxygen content but low plant nutrients throughout,P.aeruginosa is the predominant inhabitant and this clearly makes it the most abundant organism on earth. 
P.aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen. It is “opportunistic” because it seldom infects healthy individuals. Instead, it often colonizes immunocompromised patients, like those with cystic fibrosis, cancer, or AIDS. It is such a potent pathogen that firstly, it attacks up two thirds of the critically-ill hospitalized patients, and this usually portends more invasive diseases. Secondly, P.aeruginosa is a leading Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen at most medical centers, carrying a 40-60% mortality rate. Thirdly, it complicates 90% of cystic fibrosis deaths; and lastly, it is always listed as one of the top three most frequent Gram-negative pathogens and is linked to the worst visual diseases. Furthermore, P.aeruginosa is a very important soil bacterium that is capable of breaking down polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and making rhamnolipids, quinolones, hydrogen cyanide, phenazines, and lectins. It also exhibits intrinsic resistance to a lot of different types of chemotherapeutic agents and antibiotics, making it a very hard pathogen to eliminate.

										<h3>Diseases Brought about by Chlamydia trachomatis</h3>						
										<p>
										In the United States, Chlamydia trachomatis (tra-KO-ma-tis) is responsible for more cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than any other organism. Sexually transmitted diseases are passed from one partner to another during sexual activity. It is estimated that between 4 and 8 million people are infected in the United States by Chlamydia trachomatis every year.
Chlamydia trachomatis also causes an eye infection called trachoma (tra-KO-ma), which is an inflammation of the membrane covering the eye. It causes the eye to become irritated and red with a thick discharge. Infants whose mothers' have Chlamydia infections may become infected during birth. These infants can develop eye infections a few days after birth or pneumonia several weeks after birth.
